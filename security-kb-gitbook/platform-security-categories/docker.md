# Docker


### Docker Security

1. Use the “secure” Docker base images: [https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/managed-base-images](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/managed-base-images)
2. [https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/get-image-vulnerabilities](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/get-image-vulnerabilities) scan your images and respond to that regularly. 
   * Feel free to put your images in any supported repository but ALSO put it in GCR to take advantage of this.
