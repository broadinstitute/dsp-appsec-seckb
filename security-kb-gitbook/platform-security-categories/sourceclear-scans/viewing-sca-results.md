# Viewing SCA results

Results from our SCA scans are collected in [Defect Dojo](https://defectdojo.dsp-appsec.broadinstitute.org/dashboard) for each repository in Terra. To access the results you will need to be logged into the Broad VPN or on the office wifi. If there is any issue or question concerning accessing the results, please drop us a note in #dsp-infosec-champions on slack.&#x20;
