# Threat Modeling

### Introduction

Threat modeling is an approach for analyzing the security of an application. It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. 

The purpose is to review the current security controls in the application architecture. This helps AppSec team to identify potential security flaws at an early stage and mitigate them before starting the development stage.

### Scope

While doing threat modeling/secure architecture review we can primarily focus on the following areas:

* [ ]  Application Architecture Documents
* [ ]  Deployment and Infrastructure Considerations
* [ ]  Input Validation
* [ ]  Authentication
* [ ]  Authorization
* [ ]  Configuration Management
* [ ]  Session Management
* [ ]  Cryptography
* [ ]  Parameter Manipulation
* [ ]  Exception Management
* [ ]  Auditing & Logging
* [ ]  Application Framework and Libraries
