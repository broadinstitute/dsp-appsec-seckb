# Threat Modeling

### Introduction

Threat modeling is an approach for analyzing the security of an application. It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application.

   **Threat Modeling Basics**

* **What?** 
  * A repeatable process to find and address all threats to your product  
* **Why?**  
  * Because attackers think differently
  * Find problems when thereâ€™s time to fix them 
  * Security Development Lifecycle \(SDL\) requirement 
  * Deliver more secure products 
* **When?** 
  * The earlier you start, the more time to plan and fix 
  * Worst case is for when youâ€™re trying to ship: Find problems, make ugly scope and schedule choices, revisit those features soon

### Scope

While doing threat modeling/secure architecture review we can primarily focus on the following areas:

* [ ]  Application Architecture Documents
* [ ]  Deployment and Infrastructure Considerations
* [ ]  Input Validation
* [ ]  Authentication
* [ ]  Authorization
* [ ]  Configuration Management
* [ ]  Session Management
* [ ]  Cryptography \(if applicable - hopefully not applicable ðŸ˜…\)  
* [ ]  Parameter Manipulation
* [ ]  Exception Management
* [ ]  Auditing & Logging
* [ ]  Application Framework and Libraries
