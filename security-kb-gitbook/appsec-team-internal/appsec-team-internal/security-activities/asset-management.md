# Asset Management

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Asset Management and Engagement Tracking" %}
**Description:**

Where is our catalog of applications and related assets (domains, databases, infrastructure, and more)? Where do we keep track of engagements?

**Tools:**

* [DefectDojo](https://defect-dojo.dsp-appsec.broadinstitute.org/dashboard)
* Sdarq
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Vulnerability Management" %}
**Description:**

More often than not, we are going to discover more vulnerabilities that can be patched while engineering can still hit product milestones. Itâ€™s important for us to help the organization balance vulnerabilities against features, and not only advocates to fix vulnerabilities. If a complete fix for a vulnerability will take too much time, consider mitigating controls instead to reduce the risk.

**Tools:**

* [Jira](https://broadinstitute.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa)
* [DefectDojo](https://defect-dojo.dsp-appsec.broadinstitute.org/dashboard)
* [CodeDx](https://codedx.dsp-appsec.broadinstitute.org/codedx/login)
