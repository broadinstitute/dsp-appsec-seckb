### Asset Management and Engagement Tracking

**Description:**

Where is our catalog of applications and related assets (domains, databases, infrastructure, and more). Where do we keep track of engagements?

**Tools:**
* DefectDojo:[https://defect-dojo.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/dashboard](https://defect-dojo.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/dashboard)

### Threat Modeling

**Description:**

Catching security risks and flaws early saves time and effort (and money). Design Review/Secure Architecture Analysis is an activity that is done as early as possible when a new service is spun up and it's a continuous process. 

**Tools:**
* Lucidchart:[https://www.lucidchart.com/](https://www.lucidchart.com/)

### Vulnerability Management

**Description:**

More often than not, we are going to discover more vulnerabilities that can be patched while engineering can still hit product milestones. Itâ€™s important for us to help the organization balance vulnerabilities against features, and not only advocates to fix vulnerabilities. If a complete fix for a vulnerability will take too much time, consider mitigating controls instead to reduce the risk. 

**Tools:**
* Jira:[https://broadinstitute.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa](https://broadinstitute.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa)

* DefectDojo:[https://defect-dojo.dsptechops.broadinstitute.org/dashboard](https://defect-dojo.dsptechops.broadinstitute.org/dashboard)

* CodeDx:[https://codedx101.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/codedx/projects/](https://codedx101.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/codedx/projects/)
