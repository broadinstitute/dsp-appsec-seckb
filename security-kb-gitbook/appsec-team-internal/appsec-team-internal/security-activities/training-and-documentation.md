# Training and Documentation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Security Training" %}
**Description:**

Engineers should go through some sort of application security training once a year and when they join the organization. This training should cover everything engineers need to know about working with security including how to prevent against OWASP top 10.

**Tools:**

* Codebashing:[https://www.learn.codebashing.com](https://www.learn.codebashing.com)

**How Can We Do Better?**

* Codebashing currently in progress.
* Need to train new Developers once they join and make security training part of the required training.
* How can we provide more team-specific granular training?
* Hunter: [https://hunter2.com/](https://hunter2.com/) \(Albano Drazhi is currently evaluating their learning modules\).
* Onboarding curriculum
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Documentation & Internal KB" %}
**Description:**

It should include secure engineering guidelines advice from infrastructure security, and recommendations on what needs to be logged and how. Any common security libraries or anti-patterns should be documented for engineers to refer to without having to ask product security.

**Tools:**

* Security KB:[https://dsp-security.broadinstitute.org/](https://dsp-security.broadinstitute.org/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Security Knowledge/Rules \(Internal\)" %}
**Description:**

Sort of a framework in order to create a guide-system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design from the start.

**Tools:** No tools currently in use.
