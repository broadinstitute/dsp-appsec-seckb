# Terra Best Practices

### Access to Terra

The devops team should be making prod projects and managing users on them. You can contact them via 

All privileged access to Terra, including access to production data, must be through a user’s `@firecloud.org` account that is assigned to them only after the user completes all prerequisites for privileged access. This account is the only user account that may be granted privileged access; a user’s `@broadinstitute.org` account may not be used in place of the @firecloud.org account for privileged access/functions.

If there is a circumstance in which a @firecloud.org account cannot be used for a privileged function, an exception can be considered. The circumstance must be documented and justified.
