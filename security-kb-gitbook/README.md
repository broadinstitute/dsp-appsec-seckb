# Introduction

The main purpose of the AppSec Pipeline is to automate, monitor, and apply security at all phases of the software lifecycle: plan, develop, build, test, release, deliver, deploy, operate, and monitor. In DevSecOps, testing and security are shifted to the left through automated unit, functional, integration, and security testing - this is a key DevSecOps differentiator since security and functional capabilities are tested and built simultaneously.
