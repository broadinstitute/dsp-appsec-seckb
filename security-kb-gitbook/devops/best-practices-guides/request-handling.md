# Request Handling

## Handling Tickets

### Locate

All incoming request tickets should be on the [AP-DevOps-Requests](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=71) board as unassigned **TO DO** tickets.

### Triage

Discuss and set ticket status and ownership to either:

* **DEFERRED** with no owner: means ticket will be left in backlog with no immediate plans to complete, but want to keep the ticket around, in case it will be done in the future or serve as information.
* **WON'T DO** with no owner: DevOps has no plans to complete this and don't need to keep track of it.
* Assign to owner and leave as **TO DO**: Owner will prioritize and complete ticket.

### Update

Owners will check their tickets on the requests board and keep their ticket states up to date. The states are:

* **TO DO**
* **IN PROGRESS**
* **BLOCKED**: if blocked, add in the ticket description what's blocking the ticket.
* **DONE**: done tickets stay on the board for 7 days and then filtered out.  They can be found later with a search, but are otherwise invisible on the requests board.
